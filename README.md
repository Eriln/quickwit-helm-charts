# Quickwit Helm Chart

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add quickwit https://helm.quickwit.io

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages. You can then run `helm search repo
quickwit` to see the charts.

To install the quickwit chart:

    helm install my-quickwit quickwit/quickwit

To uninstall the chart:

    helm delete my-quickwit

## Upgrade helm chart from 0.4.0 to 0.5.0

The way storage config is defined changed and you have to update your helm values to upgrade to 0.5.0.

The changes are:
- the `config.s3` and `config.azure_blob` values are no more supported. You now have to use the storage config as defined in the [docs](https://quickwit.io/docs/configuration/storage-config).
- the keys of secrets have changed: `s3.secret_key` is replaced by `storage.s3.secret_access_key` and `azure_blob.access_key` is replace by `storage.azure.access_key`.

## Upgrade helm chart from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0

The seed configuration has been moved from the quickwit configuration to a dedicated configuration

The changes are:
- the `config.indexes` field is moved to `seed.indexes`
- the `config.sources` field is moved to `seed.sources`
